# Introduction to the Schaefer Surplus Production Model

The Schaefer model is a simple surplus production model, used to determine how much fish is left after fishing mortality has occurred. The Schaefer Surplus Production Model has also been used to estimate the impacts of disturbance on benthic communities (e.g. Hiddink et al., 2017).

The Schaefer model equation for a discrete timestep is as follows:


$$B_{t+1} = B_t + r B_t \left(1 - \frac{B_t}{K} \right) - C_t$$

- $B_t$ represents biomass at time $t$, any biomass unit can be used as long as units are used consistently throughout the model.

- $r$ represents the population’s intrinsic growth rate, it is a dimensionless ratio. 

- $K$ represents the carrying capacity of the population, or total biomass that can be supported.

- $Ct$ represents catch during time $t$, it is the total amount of biomass removed from the system.

- $B_0$ is the initial biomass, which can also be used to represent $K$ if the system is in a baseline state.

# Data Sources

**Sources for Initial Biomass & $K$** 

Initial Biomass and $K$ can be derived from previous surveys of San Francisco Bay benthic communities. In particular, the [San Francisco Bay Benthic Macroinvertebrate Atlas](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/werc/science/san-francisco-bay-benthic-macroinvertebrate-atlas) may be helpful.

**Sources for $r$** 

$r$ may be derived from the Eden Landing study, De La Cruz et al., 2020, and other literature sources.

**sources for $c$** 

$C$ will be dependent on burial depth. The relationship between burial depth and C will be determined from the Eden Landing study and De La Cruz et al., 2020 as well as other literature sources.

# How We Will Represent Elements From The Conceptual Model

As a reminder, below is the conceptual model developed using stakeholder input.

![](conceptual_model_overview.jpg)

Since we are focusing only on the benthic community, here is the portion of the conceptual model that applies to the subtidal zone.

![](conceptual_model_benthos.jpg)

Sediment deposition factors, burial, and distance from placement will all influence $Ct$, the amount of biomass removed from the system. $Ct$ could be binary (either all benthic critters live or all die after placement), or linear, ($Ct$ increases proportionate to burial depth), or represented by a number of other equations. $Ct$ could vary based on distance to placement to create a spatial gradient.

Tides, waves, and water quality will be represented by stochasticity in $Ct$, representing random smaller mortality events, or stochasticity in $r$, the growth rate. 

Seasonality will be represented by non-random fluctuations in $Ct$ and $r$, to represent seasonal mortality events and seasonal fluctuations in growth/recruitment.

Successional stages can be represented time-since-disturbance dependent $r$ values. For example, $r$ may be higher shortly after the disturbance to capture colonization by rapidly reproducing opportunists, but then $r$ may decline to represent the transition to long-lived and slow growing colonizers.

The model could be run on an aggregate level, where biomass is representative of the entire benthic community, or multiple iterations of the model can be run simultaneously to represent the recovery of functional groups or certain species.

# Running the Model at a Single Point

The following R function can be used to calculate biomass at time $t$ using the Schaefer Surplus Production Model:

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
#schaefer surplus production model equation
SSPM <- function(Bt, r, K, Ct){
  Bt + r * Bt * (1 - (Bt / K)) - Ct
}
```

Now, we can run the model and see how biomass changes over time.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
Binit <- 1000 #initial biomass
r <- 0.75 #intrinsic growth rate
K <- 1000 #carrying capacity same as initial biomass
timestep <- 120 #120 timesteps
C <- numeric() #C is a numeric list

#now I am saying every 12 timesteps C is 450 and at all other timesteps it is 0
for (i in 1:timestep){C[i] = ifelse (i %% 12 == 0, 450, 0)}

#creating an empty list to hold biomass values at each timestep
biomass <- numeric(length = timestep)
  
#setting the first biomass value to be initial biomass
biomass[1] <- Binit

#creating a loop to run sspm
  for (t in 2:timestep){
    biomass[t] <- SSPM(
      Bt = biomass[t-1], #biomass at previous step
      r = r,
      K = K,
      Ct = C[t-1] #catch at previous step
    )
  }

#now plot biomass
plot(y = biomass, x = 1:timestep, type = "line", 
     main = "Biomass over time with periodic mortality events",
     ylab = "Biomass", xlab = "Timestep")
```

We can also introduce stochasticity into the model by varying $r$. This could represent freshwater inflows, storm events, or other variations in environmental conditions that influence recovery time.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
#create list of random r values between 0 and 1
r <- runif(timestep, 0, 1)

#creating a loop to run sspm
for (t in 2:timestep){
  biomass[t] <- SSPM(
    Bt = biomass[t-1], #biomass at previous step
    r = r[t-1], #rate at previous step
    K = K,
    Ct = C[t-1] #catch at previous step
  )
}

#plot biomass
plot(y = biomass, x = 1:timestep, type = "line",
     main = "Biomass over time with periodic mortality events and varying r", ylab = "Biomass", xlab = "Timestep")
```

# Running the Model Across a Raster

First we will create a raster containing initial biomass data to use as input data.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
#this will generate initial biomass data (I will also use this for K)

#create empty biomass raster
biomass_raster <- rast(nrows = 10, ncols = 10, 
                       xmin = 0, xmax = 10, 
                       ymin = 0, ymax = 10)

#fill with random values between 0 and 1000
values(biomass_raster) <- runif(ncell(biomass_raster), min = 0, max = 1000)

#name layer
names(biomass_raster) <- "Bt_0" 

#plot it
plot(biomass_raster,
     main = "Initial Biomass Raster")
```

Then I will run the function across the raster, using the raster values as the initial biomass and $K$.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
#setting number of time steps
time_steps <- 120

#setting up C as an empty numeric list
C <- numeric() 

#now I am saying every 12 timesteps C is 0.5 and at all other timesteps it is 0
for (i in 1:time_steps){C[i] = ifelse (i %% 12 == 0, 0.5, 0)}

#creating raster stack to hold results
output_stack <- rast()

#adding biomass raster to the stack
output_stack <- c(biomass_raster)

#saving initial biomass as K
K <- biomass_raster

#loop through timestep and apply function
for (t in 1:time_steps) {
  
  #applying function to raster layer t, where x is the value in each raster cell
  bt_raster <- app(c(output_stack[[t]], K), fun = function(x)
    
    SSPM(Bt = x[1], #x[2] because Bt is the 1st raster in c(output_stack[[t]], K)
         r = 0.75, #r is constant for now
         K = x[2], #x[2] because K is the 2nd raster in c(output_stack[[t]], K)
         Ct = x[1] *C[t]) #note that C is multiplied by biomass now, so c represents proportion of biomass removed
    
  )
  
  #naming the output raster
  names(bt_raster) <- paste0("Bt_", t)
  #adding output raster to the raster stack
  output_stack <- c(output_stack, bt_raster)
}

#testing out by plotting first 20 layers
plot(output_stack[[1:20]], 
     range = c(0, 1000) #this ensures color scale is fixed
)
```

We can also look at what is happening in a single cell.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
#extracting biomass for all timesteps from a single raster cell
cell_value <- extract(output_stack, data.frame(x = c(1), y = c(1)), ID = F)

#Pivoting data to long format and changing Time to be numeric
cell_val_long <- cell_value %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Bt_"), names_to = "Time", values_to = "Biomass") %>% 
  mutate(Time = as.numeric(gsub("Bt_", "", Time)))

#plotting it
plot(x = cell_val_long$Time, y = cell_val_long$Biomass, 
     type = "line",
     main = "Biomass over time in a single raster cell",
     ylab = "Biomass", xlab = "Timestep")
```

Next I will make an animated plot so we can see the changes.

```{r, warnings = F, messages = F, results='hide'}
#convert raster stack to a dataframe
df <- as.data.frame(output_stack, xy = TRUE)

#convert to long format
df_long <- df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Bt_"),
               names_to = "Layer",
               values_to = "Value") %>%
  #convert layer column (which represents timesteps) to ordered factor
  mutate(
    Layer = factor(
      Layer,
      levels = unique(Layer[order(as.numeric(gsub("Bt_", "", Layer)))]))
  )

#make a ggplot
p <- ggplot(df_long, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = Value)) +
  geom_raster() +
  geom_text(aes(x = 0, y = 11,
                label = paste("Layer: ", Layer)),
                data = df_long,
            inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "D") +
  theme_minimal()

#animate the plot
animated_plot <- p +
  transition_manual(Layer) +
  labs(title = "Animation of benthic recovery over time")

#these lines are commented out because they do not render in html
#instead, save the animation and render as an image in rmd text snippit

#render the animation
#animate(animated_plot, fps = 2, width = 800, height = 600)

#save the animation
#anim_save("biomass_over_time_1.gif")

```
![](biomass_over_time_1.gif)

To demonstrate how to run the Schaefer model when input variables are spatially explicit or stochastic, I will run the model with a spatially explicity $Ct$ and a stochastic $r$.

First, I will create a raster with C values.

```{r}
#creating spatially explicit C raster

#creating a blank raster
c_rast <- rast(nrows = 10, ncols = 10, xmin = 0, xmax = 10, ymin = 0, ymax = 10)

#saving coordinates of the center
center_x <- 5
center_y <- 5

#creating a matrix with higher values in the center using a 2D Gaussian equation
gaussian_matrix <- outer(1:10, 1:10, function(i, j) {
  x <- i - center_x
  y <- j - center_y
  val <- exp(- (x^2 + y^2) / (2 * 2^2))  #gaussian with sigma=2
  return(val)
})

#normalize the matrix to range from 0 to 0.9
gaussian_matrix <- 0.9 * (gaussian_matrix / max(gaussian_matrix))

#assign values to raster
values(c_rast) <- as.vector(gaussian_matrix)

#plot the raster
plot(c_rast, main = "Raster of C Values")
```

Next, I will reset the output stack and run the model. We will use the same `time_step`, `K` raster, and `biomass_raster` as inputs for timestep, K, and initial biomass, respectively. 

```{r}
#creating raster stack to hold results
output_stack <- rast()

#adding biomass raster to the stack
output_stack <- c(biomass_raster)

#loop through timestep and apply function
for (t in 1:time_steps) {
  
  #applying function to raster layer t, where x is the value in each raster cell
  bt_raster <- app(c(output_stack[[t]], K, c_rast), fun = function(x)
    
    SSPM(Bt = x[1], #x[2] because Bt is the 1st raster in c(output_stack[[t]], K)
         r = runif(1, 0, 0.5), #r is random number between 0 and 0.5
         K = x[2], #x[2] because K is the 2nd raster in c(output_stack[[t]], K)
         Ct = if (t %% 12 == 0) {x[1] * x[3]} else {0}) #every 12 steps, c is applied. In all other steps C is 0
  )
  
  #naming the output raster
  names(bt_raster) <- paste0("Bt_", t)
  #adding output raster to the raster stack
  output_stack <- c(output_stack, bt_raster)
}

#testing out by plotting first 20 layers
plot(output_stack[[1:20]], 
     range = c(0, 1000) #this ensures color scale is fixed
)

```

Now I will check to make sure that the stochasticity in $r$ is effective.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
#extracting biomass for all timesteps from a single raster cell
cell_value <- extract(output_stack, data.frame(x = c(1), y = c(1)), ID = F)

#Pivoting data to long format and changing Time to be numeric
cell_val_long <- cell_value %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Bt_"), names_to = "Time", values_to = "Biomass") %>% 
  mutate(Time = as.numeric(gsub("Bt_", "", Time)))

#plotting it
plot(x = cell_val_long$Time, y = cell_val_long$Biomass, 
     type = "line",
     main = "Biomass over time in a single raster cell",
     ylab = "Biomass", xlab = "Timestep")
```
And finally, I will make an animation.

```{r, warnings = F, messages = F, results='hide'}
#convert raster stack to a dataframe
df <- as.data.frame(output_stack, xy = TRUE)

#convert to long format
df_long <- df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Bt_"),
               names_to = "Layer",
               values_to = "Value") %>%
  #convert layer column (which represents timesteps) to ordered factor
  mutate(
    Layer = factor(
      Layer,
      levels = unique(Layer[order(as.numeric(gsub("Bt_", "", Layer)))]))
  )

#make a ggplot
p <- ggplot(df_long, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = Value)) +
  geom_raster() +
  geom_text(aes(x = 0, y = 11,
                label = paste("Layer: ", Layer)),
                data = df_long,
            inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "D") +
  theme_minimal()

#animate the plot
animated_plot <- p +
  transition_manual(Layer) +
  labs(title = "Animation of benthic recovery over time")

#these lines are commented out because they do not render in html
#instead, save the animation and render as an image in rmd text snippit

#render the animation
#animate(animated_plot, fps = 2, width = 800, height = 600)

#save the animation
#anim_save("biomass_over_time_2.gif")
```
